# Ambient Light For PC

The project aims to help users to add an ambient light sensor to help control the brightness of the display smarter.

On the night I was hated or abandoned by one of my closest friends, I got insomnia. I felt endlessly frustrated and miserable as well as defeated. I felt that life had lost hope. However, I still hope to come out of this haze soon. Therefore I decided to do something to fulfill my life and temporarily ease my desperation. Since that my laptop (MSI GS66) hasn't any ambient light sensor, I have to tolerant the stupid way to control my brightness. Regarding occupying the camera all the time is a nonsense way to solve such problem, I have to design a new way.

This project is based on [1].
